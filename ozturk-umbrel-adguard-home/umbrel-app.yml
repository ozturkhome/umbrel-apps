releaseNotes: >
  As promised in the notes for the previous release, this update brings some quality-of-life improvements as well as a few bug fixes ðŸ”§.

  Full changelog
  See also the v0.107.46 GitHub milestone.

  Added
  Ability to disable the use of system hosts file information for query resolution (#6610).

  Ability to define custom directories for storage of query log files and statistics (#5992).

  Changed
  Private rDNS resolution (dns.use_private_ptr_resolvers in YAML configuration) now requires a valid "Private reverse DNS servers", when enabled (#6820).

  NOTE: Disabling private rDNS resolution behaves effectively the same as if no private reverse DNS servers provided by user and by the OS.

  Fixed
  Statistics for 7 days displayed by day on the dashboard graph (#6712).

  Missing "served from cache" label on long DNS server strings (#6740).

  Incorrect tracking of the system hosts file's changes (#6711).
