  Acknowledgements
  A special thanks to our open-source contributors, @hoang-rio, as well as to everyone who filed and inspected issues, added translations, and helped us test this release!

  Security
  Go version has been updated to prevent the possibility of exploiting the Go vulnerabilities fixed in Go 1.21.8.
  Added
  Ability to disable the use of system hosts file information for query resolution (#6610).
  Changed
  Private RDNS resolution (dns.use_private_ptr_resolvers in YAML configuration) now requires a valid "Private reverse DNS servers", when enabled (#6820).

  NOTE: Disabling private RDNS resolution behaves effectively the same as if no private reverse DNS servers provided by user and by the OS.

  Fixed
  Statistics for 7 days displayed by day on the dashboard graph (#6712).

  Missing "served from cache" label on long DNS server strings (#6740).
